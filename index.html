    <h3>Things to understand</h3>
    <li>Repositories: A repository is like a project's folder, which contains all the files, folders, and the entire history of changes for your project.</li>
    <li>Commits: A commit represents a specific version of your project. Each commit captures a snapshot of your code at a particular point in time.</li>
    <li>Branches: Branches are parallel versions of your code. They allow multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Merge: Merging combines changes from one branch into another. It helps consolidate work and resolve conflicts that may arise when different branches modify the same file</li>

    <br/>

    <h3>Stages in Git</h3>
    <li>Working Directory:</li>
    <li>Staging Environment</li>
